# Elementor AI Prompt Master v2.0

A high-end professional utility for developers to bridge the gap between modern web code (HTML/JSX/React) and Elementor v3.0+ Flexbox/Grid architectures.

## 🚀 New in v2.0
- **Paste-Ready JSON Conversion**: Instantly transform standard Elementor template JSON into the specific "Paste" format required for direct clipboard insertion in the Elementor editor.

- **Improved UI Stability**: Fixed tab label clipping and squishing issues on smaller viewports.
- **Side-by-Side Default View**: Optimized for widescreen monitors with a refined split-screen workspace enabled by default.
- **Refined Action Bar**: Grouped "Save JSON" and "Copy Paste-Ready" buttons into a single row for a faster conversion workflow.
- **Version 2.0 Engine**: Minor updates to the master bridge prompt for even better container hierarchy detection.
